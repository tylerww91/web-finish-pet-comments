# Pet Comments Supabase: Detail Page with Related Data

## The Golden Rule:

ü¶∏ ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è `Stop starting and start finishing.` üèÅ

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

Work incrementally, being fully done, one small step at a time!

## Demo

Use [this template](https://github.com/alchemycodelab/web-finish-pet-comments) for this deliverable.

## Live Example:

[Demo](https://alchemy-web-pet-lover.netlify.app/)

## Setup Supabase

You have three options for which supabase project to use:

1. Use the shared supabase project by sticking with the `URL` and `KEY` already in `fetch-utils.js`
1. If you already have your own supabase pet-lover project instance, you can [Run the `db.sql` setup scripts](https://github.com/alchemycodelab/student-resources/blob/main/resources/supabase/run-setup-scripts.md) to add the new comments table
1. [Create a new supabase project](https://github.com/alchemycodelab/student-resources/blob/main/resources/supabase/new-project.md):
    1. [Run the `db-part-1.sql` setup scripts](https://github.com/alchemycodelab/student-resources/blob/main/resources/supabase/run-setup-scripts.md)
    1. [Run the `db.sql` setup scripts](https://github.com/alchemycodelab/student-resources/blob/main/resources/supabase/run-setup-scripts.md)

Having your own project will enable you to inspect the result of uploading images and inserting data rows. With option #2 or #3, **make sure to [update your `URL` and `KEY`](https://github.com/alchemycodelab/student-resources/blob/main/resources/supabase/client-url-api-key.md)**

## Requirements

### Part C: Pet Comments
